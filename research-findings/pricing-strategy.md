# Pricing Strategy & Revenue Model

**Project:** DumuWaks 2.0 Expansion Research
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Purpose:** Define pricing structures, commission models, and revenue projections for DumuWaks platform

---

## Executive Summary

DumuWaks will use a **hybrid revenue model** combining transaction-based commissions (12-15%), booking fees (KES 20-50), and subscription models for high-frequency users. This model balances competitiveness with worker earnings, customer affordability, and platform profitability.

**Key Findings:**
- **Commission:** 12-15% (vs 20-30% for competitors) provides competitive advantage while covering costs
- **Booking Fee:** KES 20-50 per transaction (vs KES 50-200 for competitors)
- **Subscriptions:** Unlocks predictable revenue and higher LTV (lifetime value)
- **Breakeven:** Achievable at 10,000 bookings/month (Month 7-9)

**Revenue Projection (Year 1):** KES 24.3 million ($187,000)
**Revenue Projection (Year 2):** KES 125.4 million ($965,000)

## 1. Pricing Principles

### **Core Principles**

1. **Worker-Friendly:** Lower commissions (12-15% vs 20-30%) attract and retain quality workers
2. **Customer-Affordable:** Fees low enough not to deter bookings
3. **Category-Specific:** Different pricing for different service categories
4. **Volume-Based Incentives:** Reward high-performing workers with lower commission
5. **Transparent Pricing:** No hidden fees, clear breakdown for both workers and customers
6. **Market-Based:** Prices aligned with what customers already pay (platform convenience, not premium pricing)

---

## 2. Commission Structure

### **2.1 Standard Commission Rates**

| Category | Commission Rate | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Barbers/Hairdressers** | 12% | High frequency, low ticket size, low risk |
| **Home Cleaners** | 15% | Moderate frequency, moderate risk (home access) |
| **Motorcycle Mechanics** | 15% | Lower frequency, high ticket size, moderate complexity |
| **Auto Mechanics** | 15% | Lower frequency, very high ticket size, complex |
| **Massage Therapists** | 15% | Low frequency, high ticket size, high trust requirement |
| **Personal Trainers** | 12% | High frequency (recurring), subscription potential |
| **Electricians** | 15% | Moderate frequency, technical skill, safety risk |
| **Plumbers** | 15% | Moderate frequency, technical skill, home access |
| **Carpenters** | 15% | Lower frequency, technical skill |
| **Painters** | 15% | Lower frequency, project-based |
| **Photographers** | 12% | Low frequency, very high ticket, creative work |
| **Event Decorators** | 12% | Low frequency, high ticket, creative work |
| **Tutors** | 12% | High frequency, recurring, knowledge-based |
| **Gardeners** | 12% | Moderate frequency, outdoor work, low risk |

**Average Commission:** 13.5% (weighted by category volume)

**Competitive Comparison:**
- **Lynx:** 20-25%
- **Jumia Services:** 25-30%
- **Tujenge:** 15-20%
- **DumuWaks:** 12-15% ✅

**Advantage:** Workers keep 85-88% of earnings (vs 70-80% on other platforms). This is a major selling point for worker acquisition.

---

### **2.2 Tiered Commission Structure (Volume Incentives)**

**Purpose:** Reward high-performing workers and encourage loyalty

| Tier | Monthly Bookings | Commission Rate | Example Worker Earnings |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Bronze** | 1-10 bookings | 15% | KES 30,000 revenue → Worker keeps KES 25,500 |
| **Silver** | 11-25 bookings | 13% | KES 60,000 revenue → Worker keeps KES 52,200 |
| **Gold** | 26-50 bookings | 11% | KES 120,000 revenue → Worker keeps KES 106,800 |
| **Platinum** | 51+ bookings | 9% | KES 200,000 revenue → Worker keeps KES 182,000 |

**Impact:** Workers are motivated to complete more jobs to unlock lower commission. Top performers (Platinum) keep 91% of earnings vs 70-80% on competitors.

**Note:** Tier resets monthly (prevents workers from gaming system by booking 1 job/month to stay in top tier)

---

### **2.3 Category-Specific Commission Examples**

**Example 1: Barber (KES 400 haircut)**
- Standard commission (12%): KES 48
- Customer pays: KES 400 + KES 30 booking fee = KES 430
- Worker receives: KES 400 - KES 48 = KES 352
- **DumuWaks revenue:** KES 48 (commission) + KES 30 (booking fee) = KES 78

**Example 2: Home Cleaner (KES 1,500 cleaning)**
- Standard commission (15%): KES 225
- Customer pays: KES 1,500 + KES 40 booking fee = KES 1,540
- Worker receives: KES 1,500 - KES 225 = KES 1,275
- **DumuWaks revenue:** KES 225 (commission) + KES 40 (booking fee) = KES 265

**Example 3: Auto Mechanic (KES 8,000 repair)**
- Standard commission (15%): KES 1,200
- Customer pays: KES 8,000 + KES 100 booking fee = KES 8,100
- Worker receives: KES 8,000 - KES 1,200 = KES 6,800
- **DumuWaks revenue:** KES 1,200 (commission) + KES 100 (booking fee) = KES 1,300

**Example 4: Personal Trainer (KES 2,500 session)**
- Standard commission (12%): KES 300
- Customer pays: KES 2,500 + KES 30 booking fee = KES 2,530
- Worker receives: KES 2,500 - KES 300 = KES 2,200
- **DumuWaks revenue:** KES 300 (commission) + KES 30 (booking fee) = KES 330

---

## 3. Booking Fees

### **3.1 Booking Fee Structure**

| Ticket Size | Booking Fee | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **< KES 1,000** | KES 20 | Low fee for affordability (barbers, tutors) |
| **KES 1,000 - 3,000** | KES 30 | Standard fee (cleaners, trainers) |
| **KES 3,000 - 10,000** | KES 50 | Moderate fee (mechanics, electricians) |
| **> KES 10,000** | KES 100 | Higher fee for expensive jobs (major repairs, renovations) |

**Competitive Comparison:**
- **Lynx:** KES 50-100
- **Jumia Services:** KES 100-200
- **DumuWaks:** KES 20-100 ✅ (Lower across all tiers)

**Advantage:** Lower booking fees attract price-sensitive customers (students, middle-class families) who might avoid platforms with higher fees.

---

### **3.2 Who Pays the Booking Fee?**

**Option A: Customer Pays (Recommended)**
- Customer pays booking fee + service price
- **Pros:** Clear for workers (they know exactly what they'll earn), customers accept booking fees (standard industry practice)
- **Cons:** Slightly higher total cost for customers
- **Example:** Cleaner charges KES 1,500 → Customer pays KES 1,500 + KES 40 = KES 1,540

**Option B: Worker Pays**
- Worker absorbs booking fee from their earnings
- **Pros:** Appears cheaper to customers (no extra fees)
- **Cons:** Workers resent it (reduces their effective earnings), workers may raise prices to compensate
- **Example:** Cleaner charges KES 1,500 → Worker receives KES 1,500 - KES 40 (booking fee) - KES 225 (commission) = KES 1,235

**Option C: Split Fee (Not Recommended)**
- Customer pays 50%, worker pays 50%
- **Pros:** Shared burden
- **Cons:** Confusing for both parties, accounting complexity

**Recommendation:** **Option A (Customer Pays)** is standard and clearest for all parties.

---

## 4. Subscription Models

### **4.1 Worker Subscriptions**

**Purpose:** Workers pay monthly fee for 0% commission (keep 100% of earnings)

**Tiers:**

| Plan | Monthly Fee | Commission | Best For |
|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Free** | KES 0 | 12-15% | New workers testing platform |
| **Starter** | KES 500 | 8% | Part-time workers (5-10 bookings/month) |
| **Professional** | KES 1,000 | 5% | Full-time workers (15-25 bookings/month) |
| **Premium** | KES 2,000 | 0% | High-volume workers (30+ bookings/month) |

**Break-Even Analysis for Workers:**

**Example: Barber earning KES 40,000/month (100 bookings × KES 400)**

| Plan | Monthly Fee | Commission | Total Cost | Net Earnings |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Free** | KES 0 | 15% of KES 40K = KES 6,000 | KES 6,000 | KES 34,000 |
| **Starter** | KES 500 | 8% of KES 40K = KES 3,200 | KES 3,700 | KES 36,300 ✅ |
| **Professional** | KES 1,000 | 5% of KES 40K = KES 2,000 | KES 3,000 | KES 37,000 ✅ |
| **Premium** | KES 2,000 | 0% | KES 2,000 | KES 38,000 ✅✅ |

**Worker Saves:** KES 4,000/month by upgrading to Premium plan

**Benefit for DumuWaks:**
- Predictable revenue (subscriptions vs variable commissions)
- Higher worker retention (subscribed workers less likely to leave)
- Workers invested in platform success

**Launch Timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Commission-only model (test pricing, validate market)
- **Phase 2 (Months 7-12):** Launch subscriptions (start with Premium plan, expand to others)

---

### **4.2 Customer Subscriptions**

**Purpose:** Customers pay monthly fee for unlimited booking (no booking fees)

**Tiers:**

| Plan | Monthly Fee | Benefits | Target Customer |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Pay-As-You-Go** | KES 0 | Pay booking fee per transaction (KES 20-100) | Occasional users |
| **Regular** | KES 500/month | 0 booking fees, 5% discount on services | 3-5 bookings/month |
| **Frequent** | KES 1,000/month | 0 booking fees, 10% discount, priority support | 6-10 bookings/month |
| **Unlimited** | KES 2,000/month | 0 booking fees, 15% discount, priority booking, dedicated concierge | 10+ bookings/month |

**Target Customers:**

**Regular Plan (KES 500/month):**
- Middle-class families (weekly cleaning, bi-weekly gardener)
- **Bookings:** 4/month (weekly cleaner)
- **Savings vs Pay-As-You-Go:** Booking fees saved = 4 × KES 40 = KES 160
- **Additional savings:** 5% discount on services = 5% × KES 6,000 (monthly cleaning spend) = KES 300
- **Total savings:** KES 460/month (subscription pays for itself)

**Frequent Plan (KES 1,000/month):**
- Busy professionals (weekly barber visit, bi-weekly cleaner, monthly massage)
- **Bookings:** 8/month
- **Savings vs Pay-As-You-Go:** Booking fees saved = 8 × KES 40 (avg) = KES 320
- **Additional savings:** 10% discount on services = 10% × KES 15,000 (monthly service spend) = KES 1,500
- **Total savings:** KES 1,820/month (subscription pays for itself 1.8x)

**Unlimited Plan (KES 2,000/month):**
- Wealthy families or businesses (daily cleaner, weekly barber/gardener/trainer, multiple services)
- **Bookings:** 15+/month
- **Savings vs Pay-As-You-Go:** Booking fees saved = 15 × KES 40 = KES 600
- **Additional savings:** 15% discount = 15% × KES 40,000 = KES 6,000
- **Total savings:** KES 6,600/month (subscription pays for itself 3.3x)

**Launch Timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Pay-as-you-go only (focus on acquiring users)
- **Phase 2 (Months 7-12):** Launch Regular and Frequent plans
- **Phase 3 (Months 13+):** Launch Unlimited plan

## 5. Pricing by Category

### **5.1 Market Price Research**

**Average Service Prices in Kenya (2025-2026):**

| Service | Typical Price Range | DumuWaks Price | Premium Price (Mobile/Home Service) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Barber (Men's Cut)** | KES 200-500 | KES 300-400 | KES 500-700 (home/office visit) |
| **Hairdresser (Women's Styling)** | KES 300-800 | KES 400-600 | KES 700-1,000 (home visit) |
| **Home Cleaning (per session)** | KES 500-1,500 | KES 800-1,200 | KES 1,200-1,800 (deep cleaning) |
| **Mechanic (Labor, per hour)** | KES 800-1,500 | KES 1,000-1,200 | KES 1,500 (emergency/mobile) |
| **Mechanic (Oil Change)** | KES 1,500-3,000 | KES 2,000-2,500 | KES 3,000 (home service) |
| **Massage (60 min)** | KES 2,000-5,000 | KES 3,000-4,000 | KES 5,000 (home/hotel visit) |

| **Electrician (per hour)** | KES 800-1,500 | KES 1,000-1,200 | KES 1,500 (emergency) |
| **Plumber (per hour)** | KES 800-1,500 | KES 1,000-1,200 | KES 1,500 (emergency) |
| **Photographer (per event)** | KES 10,000-50,000 | KES 15,000-30,000 | KES 40,000+ (premium packages) |
| **Event Decorator (per event)** | KES 20,000-100,000 | KES 30,000-60,000 | KES 80,000+ (premium) |

**Pricing Strategy:**
- DumuWaks prices at **mid-market** (not cheapest, not most expensive)
- Workers can set their own prices within DumuWaks guidelines (minimum and maximum)
- **Mobile/Home Service Premium:** 20-50% higher prices for convenience
- **Emergency/Urgent Service:** 25-50% higher prices (same-day or after-hours)

---

### **5.2 Dynamic Pricing (Future Feature, Phase 3)**

**Concept:** Adjust prices based on demand, time, and location (similar to Uber surge pricing)

**Examples:**
- **Barber prices:** +20% on Saturdays (peak demand), -10% on Tuesday (low demand)
- **Cleaner prices:** +30% during end-of-month rush, +50% on public holidays
- **Mechanic prices:** +40% for emergency same-day service
- **Location-based:** Higher prices in wealthy neighborhoods (Karen, Muthaiga) vs lower-income areas

**Implementation:**
- **Phase 1-2:** Fixed prices (keep it simple)
- **Phase 3 (Months 13+):** Test dynamic pricing with select workers
- **Phase 4 (Months 19+):** Roll out dynamic pricing platform-wide

**Customer Communication:**
- Must be transparent (show "Higher demand: +20% pricing")
- Allow customers to schedule for later to avoid surge pricing
- Cap surge pricing at maximum 50% (prevent price gouging)

---

**Year 1 Total Revenue:** KES 17.3 million (from core commission model)
**Plus Subscriptions (Months 7-12):** KES 7.0 million (estimated)
**Total Year 1 Revenue:** KES 24.3 million

**Note:** This is conservative. If bookings grow faster (more aggressive marketing, better product-market fit), revenue could be 50-100% higher.

---

### **6.2 Year 2 Revenue (Moderate Growth)**

**Assumptions:**
- 3x growth in bookings (25,000 → 75,000 bookings/month by Month 24)
- Add massage therapists (Month 13) and personal trainers (Month 16)
- Average ticket size increases (KES 900 → KES 1,100 as mix shifts to higher-priced services)
- Subscription revenue grows (20% of workers, 10% of customers on subscriptions)

**Monthly Revenue Projection (Month 13-24):**

| Month | Bookings | Avg Ticket (KES) | Commission (13.5%) | Booking Fees | Subscriptions | Total Revenue (KES) |

**Year 2 Total Revenue:** KES 151.4 million

**Cumulative Revenue (Year 1 + Year 2):** KES 175.7 million

---

### **6.3 Revenue Breakdown by Source (Year 2)**

| Revenue Source | Annual Amount (KES) | % of Total |
|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Worker Commissions** | 115,000,000 | 76% |
| **Customer Booking Fees** | 23,000,000 | 15% |
| **Worker Subscriptions** | 9,000,000 | 6% |
| **Customer Subscriptions** | 4,400,000 | 3% |
| **Total** | **151,400,000** | **100%** |

**Key Insight:** Commissions are the majority revenue source, but subscriptions grow to 9% of revenue by Year 2, providing predictable recurring revenue.

---

## 7. Cost Structure & Profitability

### **7.1 Unit Economics (Per Booking)**

**Average Booking (Year 1):**
- Service price: KES 550
- Commission revenue: KES 74 (13.5%)
- Booking fee revenue: KES 35
- **Total revenue per booking:** KES 109

**Costs Per Booking:**
- Payment processing (M-Pesa/Card): KES 4 (3.65% of KES 109)
- Worker acquisition: KES 20 (amortized marketing cost)
- Customer support: KES 8 (staff cost per booking)
- Verification: KES 15 (amortized verification cost)
- Server/tech costs: KES 5
- **Total cost per booking:** KES 52

**Contribution Margin:** KES 109 - KES 52 = **KES 57 per booking (52% margin)**

---

### **7.2 Breakeven Analysis**

**Monthly Fixed Costs:**
- Staff salaries (5-7 people): KES 600,000
- Office rent: KES 100,000
- Server/infrastructure: KES 50,000
- Marketing (baseline): KES 200,000
- Other (legal, accounting, misc): KES 50,000
- **Total Fixed Costs:** KES 1,000,000 per month

**Breakeven Point:**
- Fixed costs: KES 1,000,000
- Contribution margin per booking: KES 57
- **Breakeven bookings:** 1,000,000 ÷ 57 = **17,544 bookings per month**

**Timeline to Breakeven:**
- Based on projections, Month 9-10 (when bookings reach 17,000/month)

**Note:** This is conservative. If we reduce fixed costs (smaller team, cheaper office) or increase contribution margin (higher average ticket), breakeven comes earlier.

---

### **7.3 Profitability Projection**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 (Projected) |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Revenue** | KES 24.3M | KES 151.4M | KES 450M |
| **COGS (Variable Costs)** | KES 11.7M | KES 72.7M | KES 216M |
| **Gross Profit** | KES 12.6M (52%) | KES 78.7M (52%) | KES 234M (52%) |
| **Fixed Costs** | KES 12.0M | KES 24.0M | KES 60.0M |
| **Net Profit** | KES 0.6M (2.5%) | KES 54.7M (36%) | KES 174M (39%) |

**Year 1:** Near breakeven (expected for startups)
**Year 2:** Profitable (36% net margin)
**Year 3:** Highly profitable (39% net margin, scale kicks in)

---

## 8. Pricing Experiments & Optimization

### **8.1 A/B Testing Plan**

**Tests to Run (Months 4-12):**

**Test 1: Commission Rate**
- **Group A:** 15% commission (current)
- **Group B:** 12% commission
- **Metric:** Worker signups, booking volume, worker retention
- **Duration:** 2 months
- **Expected Outcome:** Lower commission attracts more workers, higher booking volume

**Test 2: Booking Fee**
- **Group A:** KES 30-50 booking fee (current)
- **Group B:** KES 0 booking fee (higher commission instead)
- **Metric:** Customer conversion rate, booking volume, customer acquisition cost
- **Duration:** 2 months
- **Expected Outcome:** KES 0 fee increases customer bookings, but higher commission may deter workers

**Test 3: Subscription Pricing**
- **Group A:** KES 500/month worker subscription (current plan)
- **Group B:** KES 750/month worker subscription
- **Metric:** Subscription uptake rate, churn, revenue per worker
- **Duration:** 3 months
- **Expected Outcome:** Find optimal price that maximizes subscription revenue

**Test 4: Dynamic Pricing**
- **Group A:** Fixed prices (current)
- **Group B:** Dynamic pricing (+20% on weekends, -10% midweek)
- **Metric:** Worker earnings, customer booking patterns, satisfaction
- **Duration:** 2 months
- **Expected Outcome:** Dynamic pricing increases worker earnings during peak times

**Test 5: Premium Service Tier**
- **Group A:** Standard service (current)
- **Group B:** Premium tier (vetted workers, priority support, guaranteed quality) +30% price
- **Metric:** Customer uptake, customer satisfaction, upsell rate
- **Duration:** 3 months
- **Expected Outcome:** High-income customers (10-20%) pay for premium

### **8.2 Price Elasticity Analysis**

**Definition:** How sensitive are customers and workers to price changes?

**Customer Price Elasticity:**
- **Hypothesis:** Customers are relatively inelastic (not very price-sensitive) for essential services (mechanics, plumbers, cleaners)
- **Test:** Increase prices by 10% → measure booking volume change
- **If bookings drop <5%:** Customers are inelastic (we can raise prices)
- **If bookings drop >10%:** Customers are elastic (keep prices low)

**Worker Price Elasticity:**
- **Hypothesis:** Workers are very sensitive to commission rates (elastic)
- **Test:** Decrease commission from 15% to 12% → measure worker signups
- **If signups increase >20%:** Workers are elastic (lower commission drives growth)
- **If signups increase <10%:** Workers are inelastic (keep commission at 15%)

**Timeline:** Run elasticity tests in Months 6-9 (after we have baseline data)

## 9. Competitive Pricing Strategy

### **9.1 Price Matching (Not Recommended)**

**Definition:** Match or beat competitor prices

**Pros:**
- Attracts price-sensitive customers
- Prevents competitors from undercutting

**Cons:**
- Race to the bottom (competitors can lower prices too)
- Devalues platform quality
- Not sustainable (we can't compete on price with Facebook/WhatsApp which are free)

**Recommendation:** ❌ Don't compete on price alone. Compete on **value** (verification, reviews, convenience).

---

### **9.2 Premium Pricing (Recommended for Some Categories)**

**Definition:** Charge higher prices than competitors for superior service

**Pros:**
- Higher margins per booking
- Signals quality (customers associate price with quality)
- Attracts higher-quality workers and customers

**Cons:**
- Smaller customer base (only middle-upper income)
- Slower growth

**Recommendation:** ✅ Use premium pricing for **mobile/home services** (convenience justifies premium)

**Examples:**
- Home barber visit: KES 600 (vs KES 400 at shop) = +50% premium
- Home cleaning: KES 1,500 (vs KES 1,000 standard) = +50% premium
- Emergency mechanic: KES 1,500/hour (vs KES 1,000 standard) = +50% premium

---

### **9.3 Penetration Pricing (Recommended for Launch)**

**Definition:** Lower prices initially to gain market share, then increase over time

**Pros:**
- Rapid user acquisition
- Builds network effects (more workers → more customers → more workers)
- Discourages competitors (they can't match low prices)

**Cons:**
- Lower initial margins
- Risk of angering customers when prices increase
- May attract low-quality, price-sensitive customers

**Recommendation:** ✅ Use penetration pricing for **first 6 months only**

**Launch Pricing (Months 1-6):**
- Commission: 10% (vs 12-15% standard)
- Booking fee: KES 20 (vs KES 30-50 standard)
- **Worker value prop:** "Join now and lock in 10% commission for life"

**Price Increase (Month 7+):**
- New workers: 12-15% commission
- Existing workers: Keep 10% commission (grandfathered) → rewards early adopters
- **Customer value prop:** "Prices increasing soon, book now to lock in low fees"
