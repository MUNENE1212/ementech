| **Data Plan** | Telkom 400MB @ KES 100/day (cheapest option) |
| **Apps Used Daily** | WhatsApp (4-5 hours), Facebook (2 hours), Instagram (1 hour), TikTok (1 hour) |
| **Social Media** | 2,500 Facebook friends, 850 Instagram followers (barber work photos) |
| **Mobile Money** | M-Pesa (used for 70% of customer payments) |

**Digital Skills:**
- ✅ Very comfortable with WhatsApp (voice notes, status updates, groups)
- ✅ Can post photos on Instagram/Facebook
- ✅ Uses M-Pesa daily (send, receive, buy airtime)
- ❌ Not comfortable with complex apps (struggles with PDFs, forms)
- ❌ Limited English literacy (prefers Swahili/Sheng)

#### **Current Challenges (Pain Points)**

1. **Idle Time (30-40% of working hours):**
   - "Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons are dead. I sit in the shop from 2-5 PM with zero customers."
   - Loses KES 5,000-8,000/week in potential revenue

2. **Customer Acquisition:**
   - Relies on walk-ins and word-of-mouth only
   - Can't reach customers outside his neighborhood
   - "If I move to a different area, I start from zero"

3. **No-Show Customers:**
   - 5-8 customers/week book via WhatsApp but don't show up
   - Wastes 2-3 hours daily waiting for customers who never arrive

4. **Location Limitations:**
   - Only serves customers near Kasarani shop
   - Wants to serve Westlands/Kilimani clients (higher prices) but no customer base there

5. **Price Competition:**
   - 3 other barbershops within 500 meters
   - Competitors charging KES 200-250 (he charges KES 300)
   - "Customers don't understand I'm better quality"

6. **Seasonal Fluctuations:**
   - Month-end rush: 25-30 clients/day
   - Mid-month lull: 10-15 clients/day
   - School holidays: 50% drop in clients (students are customers)

7. **Payment Collection:**
   - 20% of customers promise to "pay later" but forget
   - Loses KES 3,000-5,000/month in unpaid services

#### **Goals & Aspirations**

**Short-term (6-12 months):**
- Increase monthly income to KES 70,000+
- Save KES 300,000 to open own barbershop
- Gain 500+ loyal repeat customers

- Employ 3-4 barbers under him
- Diversify into selling hair products wholesale

**Long-term (5+ years):**
- Open a barbershop training academy
- Start a barber franchise across Kenya

#### **Why James Would Use DumuWaks**

**Primary Motivations:**
1. **Fill Idle Time:** "If I can get just 5 extra customers/week during slow hours, that's KES 1,500-2,000 more"
2. **New Customer Access:** "I want customers in Westlands who pay KES 500-800, not KES 300"
3. **Reduce No-Shows:** "If customers pay upfront when booking, I won't waste time waiting"
4. **Mobile Bookings:** "I can visit customers at their homes and charge double"

**Barriers to Adoption:**
- Commission fee: "10-15% is high, but if it brings more customers, it's worth it"
- App complexity: "If the app is too hard to use, I'll just stick to WhatsApp"
- Trust: "Will customers actually pay? What if they cancel after I arrive?"

**Quote:**
> "I'm good at what I do. I have 50 loyal customers who come every 2 weeks. But I know there are thousands of people in Nairobi looking for a good barber, they just don't know I exist. If there was a way to reach them without paying for advertising I can't afford, I'd jump at it."

#### **Why Mary Would Use DumuWaks**

**Primary Motivators:**
1. **More Clients:** "If I can get 1 more client per day, even at KES 700, that's KES 21,000 extra per month"
2. **Reliable Payments:** "If the platform guarantees payment, I won't have clients who owe me for weeks"
3. **Fair Pricing:** "Maybe customers on the app will pay KES 1,000 instead of KES 700"
4. **Flexible Schedule:** "I can choose which days to work, not forced to work 6 days/week"

**Barriers to Adoption:**
- smartphone limitations: "My phone is slow, can I use the app?"
- Commission fee: "15% is high, but if I get more customers, okay"
- Trust: "Will the platform pay me? What if customers lie about my work?"
- Language: "Is the app in Swahili? I don't understand English well"
- Digital literacy: "I'll need help setting up the app"

**Quote:**
> "I work hard every day. I clean other people's homes until I'm exhausted, but I can't afford to send my children to good schools or buy them new clothes. If there was a way to find more clients who pay fair prices without walking around asking strangers, that would change my life. I just hope the app is simple enough for me to use."

If there was a way to reach riders all over Nakuru - or even in other towns - I'd repair 10 bikes a day, not 3. I'm ready for more work, I just need access to customers."

- **Customer Support:** "If something goes wrong, can I reach a human?"

**Quote:**
> "I work 50-60 hours a week. I don't have time to chase down referrals, call multiple providers, or wait in line. I want to open an app, see who's available, read reviews, and book in under a minute. I'll pay 20-30% extra for that convenience. Trust me, my time is worth more than that."

| **Data** | 20GB family plan @ KES 1,500/month |
| **Apps** | MySafaricom, KCB App, M-Pesa, WhatsApp, Facebook, Jumia |
| **TV** | Gotv (DSTV is too expensive) |

**Digital Behavior:**
- ✅ Comfortable with essential apps (M-Pesa, WhatsApp)
- ✅ Uses Jumia for monthly bulk shopping (diapers, toiletries)
- ✅ Uses ride-hailing apps occasionally (when car has problems)
- ❌ Not early adopters (wait for apps to prove themselves first)
- ❌ Concerned about online scams (careful with new apps)
- ✅ Read reviews before trying new services

#### **Current Services & Pain Points**

**Current Monthly Services:**
1. **Domestic Worker (Househelp):** Live-in helper (KES 15,000/month + food + accommodation)
2. **Gardener:** Comes 2x/month (KES 1,000/day, KES 2,000/month)
3. **Tutor for Ian:** Comes 3x/week (KES 500/session, KES 6,000/month)
4. **Car Mechanic:** Local garage (as needed, KES 5,000-20,000 depending on problem)
5. **Barber:** Ian's haircut (walk-in barbershop, KES 300, 2x/month)

**Major Pain Points:**

1. **Finding Good Workers:**
   - "We went through 4 househelps in 2 years before finding our current one"
   - "We can't find a reliable tutor. Some don't show up, others don't know the syllabus"
   - "Our mechanic is honest but very slow. Car stays in the garage for a week"

2. **Trust Issues (Especially with Children):**
   - "I won't let just anyone tutor my son. I need references, background checks"
   - "When the househelp is sick, we need someone trustworthy quickly"
   - "Safety is our #1 concern, more than cost"

3. **Budget Constraints:**
   - "We want quality services, but we have a budget. We can't pay KES 5,000 for a tutor"
   - "If an app helps us find good workers at fair prices, we'd use it"
   - "We compare prices before booking anything"

4. **Reliability & No-Shows:**
   - "The gardener sometimes doesn't come for 3 weeks, grass grows tall"
   - "The tutor says 'I'm coming' then texts last minute 'I can't make it'"
   - "We need reliable workers who show up on time, every time"

5. **Emergency Situations:**
   - "When our car breaks down at 8 AM, we need someone immediately"
   - "If the househelp doesn't show up, one of us stays home from work"
   - "We need same-day service options"

6. **Quality Consistency:**
   - "One barber does a great job, the next time it's different"
   - "We want to rate workers and use the same ones again"

#### **Service Needs (Monthly)**

| Service | Frequency | Current Cost | Would Pay via App |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Home Cleaner (part-time)** | 4x/month | N/A (use full-time helper) | KES 800-1,000/day (when helper is away) |
| **Tutor** | 12 sessions/month | KES 500/session | KES 600-700/session for verified tutor |
| **Gardener** | 2x/month | KES 1,000/day | KES 1,000-1,200/day for reliability |
| **Barber (for Ian)** | 2x/month | KES 300 | KES 400-500 for convenience |
| **Hairdresser (for Grace)** | 1x/month | KES 2,500 | KES 2,500-3,000 for home service |
| **Car Mechanic** | As needed | Varies | Would pay 10-15% extra for verified, reliable mechanic |

**Monthly Service Budget:** KES 25,000-30,000 (including full-time househelp)

**Would Allocate to On-Demand App:** KES 8,000-12,000/month

#### **Why Omondi Family Would Use DumuWaks**

**Primary Motivators:**
1. **Trust & Safety (Especially for Children):** "If the platform verifies workers, that's huge for us"
2. **Reliability:** "We need workers who show up on time, every time"
3. **Transparent Pricing:** "We want to know what we're paying upfront, no surprises"
4. **Quality Ratings:** "Reviews and ratings help us choose the right workers"
5. **Emergency Access:** "When we need someone same-day, we want options"

**Barriers to Adoption:**
- **Cost Concerns:** "We'll use it if prices are fair. We're budget-conscious"
- **Trust in Platform:** "We'd start with one service (like tutor) to test the platform"
- **Customer Support:** "If something goes wrong, we want to talk to a person, not a chatbot"
- **Payment Method:** "We prefer M-Pesa over card payments"

**Quote (James):**
> "We're not rich, but we're willing to pay for quality services. The problem is finding quality. We've been burned so many times by unreliable workers. If DumuWaks can guarantee that workers show up, do good work, and are safe around our children, we'd use it every week. But we need to trust the platform first."

**Quote (Grace):**
> "As a nurse, I work shifts. Sometimes I need a tutor at 6 AM, sometimes I need someone to watch the kids last-minute. I need flexible, reliable workers. If this app can provide that, it's a lifesaver. But they must do background checks. I won't let just anyone near my children."

5. **Printing:** Campus cyber cafe (KES 5/page)

**Major Pain Points:**

   - "After rent, food, and transport, I have KES 2,000-3,000 for everything else"
   - "I'd love a haircut at a nice barbershop (KES 400), but I can only afford KES 150"
   - "I need cheap services, not premium ones"

2. **Finding Services in Juja:**
   - "There are no good services near campus. I have to go to Nairobi or Thika"
   - "I needed a mechanic once, had to ask 10 friends for referrals"
   - "I'd use an app that shows me workers in Juja or nearby areas"

3. **Quality vs. Price Trade-off:**
   - "Campus barber is cheap (KES 150) but terrible. I look like a bush"
   - "I'd pay KES 300 for a good haircut, but I can't find any nearby"

4. **Emergency Services:**
   - "My laptop broke during finals. I had no idea where to find a repair guy"

   - "I only use M-Pesa. I don't have a Visa card"
   - "If an app requires card payment, I can't use it"
   - "Most apps assume everyone has a credit card. We don't"

#### **Service Needs (Monthly)**

| Service | Frequency | Current Method | Would Pay via App |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Barber** | 2x/month | Campus (KES 150) | KES 300-400 for quality barber |
| **Laundry Service** | 2x/month | Hand-wash | KES 500-700 for pickup service |

**Monthly Service Budget:** KES 2,000-4,000 (very limited)

#### **Why Brian Would Use DumuWaks**

**Primary Motivators:**
1. **Finding Affordable Options:** "I want to see prices and choose the cheaper options"
2. **Location-Based Search:** "Show me workers in Juja or Thika, not just Nairobi"
3. **Student Discounts:** "If the app has student pricing or discounts, I'd use it"
4. **M-Pesa Integration:** "I only use M-Pesa, no credit cards"
5. **Emergency Services:** "When I need something urgently, I want to see who's available now"

**Barriers to Adoption:**
- **Price:** "If all services are premium (expensive), I can't use it"
- **Location:** "Most platforms focus on Nairobi. What about students in Juja?"
- **Payment:** "Must accept M-Pesa. I can't pay by card"
- **Trust:** "I'll read reviews first. If workers have good ratings, I'll try it"

**Quote:**
> "Look, I'm a student. I don't have KES 1,000 for a haircut or KES 5,000 for a cleaning service. But I have KES 2,000-3,000/month for services. If DumuWaks has affordable options, accepts M-Pesa, and has workers near Juja campus, I'd use it. But if it's all high-end Nairobi services, it's not for me. Students need affordable, reliable services too."
