# Competitive Analysis: Service Marketplace Landscape in Kenya

**Project:** DumuWaks 2.0 Expansion Research
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Purpose:** Analyze existing competitors and identify DumuWaks' competitive differentiation opportunities

---

## Executive Summary

The Kenyan service marketplace landscape is **fragmented but growing**, with 5 direct competitors (Lynk, Tujenge, Jumia Services, Kwik, and FixKE) and numerous indirect competitors (Facebook groups, WhatsApp networks, classifieds).

**Key Finding:** No single platform dominates the informal service sector. Existing competitors have **significant gaps** in category coverage, user experience, verification quality, and geographic reach that DumuWaks can exploit.

**Primary Opportunities:**
1. **Category Specialization:** No platform excels at barbers/hairdressers or home cleaners
2. **Verification Quality:** Competitors have weak or non-existent vetting
3. **Worker Experience:** Poor worker retention due to high commissions and lack of support
4. **Geographic Gaps:** Limited coverage outside Nairobi and Mombasa

---

## 1. Direct Competitors Analysis

### **Competitor 1: Lynk** (Market Leader)

#### **Overview**
- **Founded:** 2015
- **Funding:** $1.5M+ (venture capital)
- **Headquarters:** Nairobi
- **Team Size:** 30-50 employees
- **Active Users:** Estimated 15,000-25,000 workers, 50,000-80,000 customers

#### **Service Categories Offered**

| Category | Offered? | Details |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Plumbers** | ✅ Yes | Primary category (strong offering) |
| **Electricians** | ✅ Yes | Primary category (strong offering) |
| **Mechanics** | ✅ Yes | Limited (mainly auto mechanics) |
| **Carpenters** | ✅ Yes | Moderate offering |
| **Painters** | ✅ Yes | Moderate offering |
| **Home Cleaners** | ⚠️ Limited | Small workforce, low quality |
| **Laundry** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Barbers/Hairdressers** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Massage Therapists** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Personal Trainers** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Tutors** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Photographers** | ❌ No | Not offered |

**Total Categories:** 8-10 skilled trades categories
**Category Gap:** Personal care, creative services, professional services NOT covered

#### **Pricing Model**

| Fee Type | Lynk Rate | DumuWaks Opportunity |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Customer Booking Fee** | KES 50-100 per booking | Can offer lower (KES 20-50) or waive |
| **Worker Commission** | 20-25% per job | Can offer lower (12-15%) |
| **Subscription** | None offered | Can introduce worker subscriptions |
| **Membership** | None offered | Can introduce premium memberships |

**Example:** For a KES 5,000 plumbing job:
- Customer pays: KES 5,000 + KES 100 booking fee = KES 5,100
- Worker receives: KES 5,000 - 25% commission (KES 1,250) = KES 3,750
- **Lynk Revenue:** KES 1,350 per job (27% effective take rate)

#### **Verification Process**

| Check Type | Lynk Method | Quality |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Identity Verification** | National ID upload | Basic (photo only) |
| **Skill Verification** | Self-reported skills, no testing | Weak |
| **Background Checks** | None | Critical gap |
| **Reference Checks** | None | Critical gap |
| **In-Person Vetting** | None | Critical gap |
| **Portfolio Review** | For some creative workers | Inconsistent |
| **Customer Reviews** | Yes, 5-star rating system | Good |

**Verification Weakness:** Lynk relies heavily on customer reviews to weed out bad workers. This creates a "chicken-and-egg" problem where new workers can't get their first jobs without reviews.

#### **User Experience (App/Web)**

**Customer App:**
- ✅ Clean, modern UI
- ✅ Location-based search
- ✅ Real-time availability
- ✅ In-app payments (M-Pesa, Card)
- ❌ Long wait times for some services (2-5 days)
- ❌ Limited worker information (no photos, limited bio)
- ❌ No video profiles

**Worker App:**
- ✅ Easy job acceptance
- ✅ Earnings tracking
- ❌ High commission causes resentment
- ❌ Poor customer support (workers report slow response)
- ❌ No tools for business management (no scheduling, no client database)

#### **Geographic Coverage**

| Area | Coverage | Quality |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Nairobi** | ✅ Full coverage | Strong (all neighborhoods) |
| **Mombasa** | ⚠️ Limited coverage | Moderate (only certain areas) |
| **Kisumu** | ❌ Very limited | Weak (pilots only) |
| **Nakuru** | ❌ No coverage | Not available |
| **Other Towns** | ❌ No coverage | Not available |

**Coverage Gap:** Only 2 cities with meaningful coverage. DumuWaks can target secondary cities (Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu) that Lynk ignores.

#### **Strengths**

1. **First-Mover Advantage:** Well-known brand in Nairobi
2. **Venture Capital Funding:** Can spend on marketing
3. **Broad Trades Coverage:** Strong in plumbing, electrical, carpentry
4. **Tech Platform:** Solid app infrastructure
5. **Partnerships:** Works with corporates (banks, real estate companies)

#### **Weaknesses**

1. **High Commissions (20-25%):** Workers resent losing 1/4 of earnings
2. **Limited Categories:** Missing barbers, cleaners, tutors, trainers
3. **Poor Verification:** No background checks, no skill testing
4. **Worker Retention Issues:** High churn due to low net earnings
5. **Long Wait Times:** Customers often wait 2-5 days for service
6. **Poor Customer Support:** Workers and customers complain about slow responses
7. **Geographic Limitations:** Only Nairobi and parts of Mombasa

#### **Reviews & Sentiment**

**Google Play Store Rating:** 3.8/5 (2,500+ reviews)

**Common Customer Complaints:**
- "Took 4 days to find a plumber"
- "Worker showed up late and did poor job"
- "Customer service doesn't respond when there are problems"
- "Booking fee is expensive"

**Common Worker Complaints:**
- "25% commission is too high, I barely make profit"
- "Support takes 3-5 days to respond to my issues"
- "Too much competition for jobs, I only get 1-2/week"
- "Customers cancel last-minute and I still pay commission"

---

### **Competitor 2: Tujenge** (Emerging Player)

#### **Overview**
- **Founded:** 2019
- **Funding:** Bootstrapped + small angel round
- **Headquarters:** Nairobi
- **Team Size:** 8-12 employees
- **Active Users:** Estimated 3,000-5,000 workers, 10,000-15,000 customers

#### **Service Categories Offered**

| Category | Offered? | Details |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Construction Workers** | ✅ Yes | Primary focus (masons, fundis) |
| **Plumbers** | ✅ Yes | Moderate offering |
| **Electricians** | ✅ Yes | Moderate offering |
| **Painters** | ✅ Yes | Moderate offering |
| **Home Cleaners** | ⚠️ Pilot | Small pilot program |
| **Gardeners** | ⚠️ Limited | Small workforce |
| **Barbers** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Mechanics** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Others** | ❌ No | Not offered |

**Total Categories:** 5-6 construction/trades categories
**Focus:** Construction and home renovation (not general services)

#### **Pricing Model**

| Fee Type | Tujenge Rate | DumuWaks Opportunity |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Customer Booking Fee** | None | Similar or can add small fee |
| **Worker Commission** | 15-20% per job | Can match or go lower (12-15%) |
| **Lead Generation** | KES 50-100 per lead | Different model (not commission) |

**Note:** Tujenge primarily uses a lead-generation model where workers pay to receive customer leads, not commission on completed jobs.

#### **Verification Process**

| Check Type | Tujenge Method | Quality |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| **Identity Verification** | National ID upload | Basic |
| **Skill Verification** | Portfolio review only | Weak |
| **Background Checks** | None | Critical gap |
| **In-Person Vetting** | None | Critical gap |
| **Reference Checks** | None | Critical gap |

**Verification Quality:** Similar to Lynk (weak), but smaller scale makes quality control easier.

#### **Strengths**

1. **Lower Commissions (15-20%):** More attractive to workers
2. **Construction Focus:** Underserved niche (home renovation boom)
3. **Simple Platform:** Easy to use, less complex than Lynk
4. **Personal Touch:** Small team provides better customer support

#### **Weaknesses**

1. **Very Limited Categories:** Only construction trades
2. **Small Scale:** Limited workforce and customer base
3. **No Brand Recognition:** Most Kenyans haven't heard of it
4. **Limited Funding:** Can't compete on marketing spend
5. **Poor Tech Platform:** Basic app, limited features
6. **No Mobile App:** Web-only (customers prefer apps)

#### **Opportunity for DumuWaks:**

Tujenge is not a direct threat to DumuWaks in barbers/cleaners/mechanics categories. However, if DumuWaks expands into construction services, Tujenge's lower commission model (15-20%) sets a precedent that workers may expect.

---

### **Competitor 3: Jumia Services** (E-commerce Giant)

#### **Overview**
- **Parent:** Jumia (Pan-African e-commerce)
- **Launched Services:** 2020
- **Coverage:** Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco
- **Business Model:** Extension of Jumia marketplace

#### **Service Categories Offered**

| Category | Offered? | Details |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Home Cleaners** | ✅ Yes | Primary category (strong) |
| **Laundry & Dry Cleaning** | ✅ Yes | Partnership with laundry companies |
| **Appliance Repair** | ✅ Yes | Moderate offering |
| **Plumbers** | ⚠️ Limited | Small workforce |
| **Electricians** | ⚠️ Limited | Small workforce |
| **Car Repair** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Barbers** | ❌ No | Not offered |
| **Beauty Services** | ❌ No | Not offered |

**Total Categories:** 5-6 home service categories
**Focus:** Home services (cleaning, laundry, appliance repair)

#### **Pricing Model**

| Fee Type | Jumia Rate | DumuWaks Opportunity |
|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Customer Booking Fee** | KES 100-200 | High (can compete on price) |
| **Worker Commission** | 25-30% | Very high (major opportunity) |
| **Subscription** | None offered | Can introduce |

**Example:** For a KES 1,500 home cleaning:
- Customer pays: KES 1,500 + KES 150 booking fee = KES 1,650
- Worker receives: KES 1,500 - 30% commission (KES 450) = KES 1,050
- **Jumia Revenue:** KES 600 per job (40% effective take rate)

**Key Weakness:** 30% commission is extremely high. Workers are very dissatisfied.

#### **Verification Process**

| Check Type | Jumia Method | Quality |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Identity Verification** | National ID + selfie | Moderate (better than Lynk) |
| **Background Checks** | Basic criminal check | Moderate (not comprehensive) |
| **Training** | Some workers get basic training | Good |
| **Uniforms** | Branded uniforms provided | Good (trust-building) |

**Verification Quality:** Better than Lynk, but still limited. Background checks are basic (not comprehensive).

#### **Strengths**

1. **Jumia Brand Trust:** Leverages existing Jumia customer base
2. **Marketing Power:** Large budget for customer acquisition
3. **Home Service Focus:** Strong in cleaning and laundry
4. **Uniforms & Branding:** Workers look professional (builds trust)
5. **Integrated Payments:** Can pay with Jumia Pay, M-Pesa, Card

#### **Weaknesses**

1. **Extremely High Commissions (25-30%):** Workers resent losing nearly 1/3 of earnings
2. **Poor Worker Treatment:** Workers report feeling exploited
3. **Limited Categories:** Only home services, no skilled trades
4. **Poor Customer Experience:** Long wait times, inconsistent quality
5. **One-Way Platform:** Workers can't see customer details before accepting (safety concern)
6. **High Customer Fees:** KES 100-200 booking fee deters price-sensitive customers

#### **Reviews & Sentiment**

**Google Play Store Rating:** 3.2/5 (1,000+ reviews) - **Worst among competitors**

**Common Customer Complaints:**
- "Waited 1 week for a cleaner"
- "Cleaner did poor job, platform didn't help resolve"
- "Booking fee is too expensive"
- "Hard to get refund when service is bad"

**Common Worker Complaints:**
- "30% commission is theft, not fair"
- "Jumia treats us like slaves"
- "Customers are rude, platform doesn't protect us"
- "Low prices (KES 1,000) minus 30% commission = not worth it"

#### **Opportunity for DumuWaks:**

Jumia Services is struggling in Kenya. High commissions (30%), poor reviews, and worker resentment create a major opportunity for DumuWaks to capture dissatisfied workers and customers with:
- Lower commissions (12-15% vs 30%)
- Better worker treatment and support
- Broader category coverage (barbers, mechanics, etc.)

---

### **Competitor 4: Kwik** (Delivery-Focused)

#### **Overview**
- **Founded:** 2018
- **Focus:** Package delivery (not service marketplace)
- **Service:** On-demand delivery (food, groceries, packages)
- **Relevance:** NOT a direct competitor (different business model)

**Relevance to DumuWaks:** Low. Kwik is delivery-focused, not service marketplace. However, Kwik demonstrates that on-demand mobile services can work in Kenya, which validates the market.

---

### **Competitor 5: FixKE** (Niche Player)

#### **Overview**
- **Founded:** 2020
- **Focus:** Appliance repair only (fridges, TVs, microwaves)
- **Team Size:** 5-10 employees
- **Active Users:** Estimated 500-1,000 workers, 2,000-3,000 customers

#### **Service Categories**

| Category | Offered? | Details |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Appliance Repair** | ✅ Yes | Primary and only category |
| **Other Services** | ❌ No | Not offered |

**Total Categories:** 1 category only

**Focus:** Extremely niche (appliance repair only)

#### **Pricing Model**

| Fee Type | FixKE Rate |
|----------|------------|
| **Customer Fee** | None (free to customers) |
| **Worker Commission** | 20% commission |

#### **Strengths**

1. **Niche Focus:** Does one thing well (appliance repair)
2. **Lower Commission:** 20% (vs 25-30% for competitors)
3. **Quality Vetting:** Technicians are tested on appliance repair skills

#### **Weaknesses**

1. **Single Category:** Can't expand beyond appliances
2. **Tiny Scale:** Very small user base
3. **No Brand Recognition:** Most Kenyans haven't heard of it
4. **Limited Funding:** Can't scale quickly

**Relevance to DumuWaks:** Low direct competition, but demonstrates that specialized vertical marketplaces can work.

---

## 2. Indirect Competitors

### **A. Facebook Groups & Marketplace**

#### **Scale**

- **Groups:** 500+ service-related Facebook groups in Kenya
- **Members:** 50,000-100,000 Kenyans in these groups
- **Examples:**
  - "Nairobi Mechanics & Auto Services" (12,000 members)
  - "Kenya Barbers & Hairdressers Association" (8,500 members)
  - "Nairobi Home Services" (5,000 members)
  - "JKUAT Students Services" (3,000 members)

#### **How It Works**

1. **Worker posts:** "I'm a barber in Kasarani, affordable rates KES 300, call 07XX XXX XXX"
2. **Customer sees post:** Calls or WhatsApps the worker directly
3. **Payment:** Cash or M-Pesa directly (no platform fees)
4. **Repeat business:** Customer saves worker's number for future bookings

#### **Strengths**

1. **Free for Workers:** No commissions or fees
2. **Direct Connection:** Worker and customer communicate directly
3. **Large Reach:** Facebook has 12+ million users in Kenya
4. **Trust Through Groups:** Members of closed groups feel more secure

#### **Weaknesses**

1. **No Verification:** Anyone can post (scam risk)
2. **No Quality Control:** No reviews, ratings, or guarantees
3. **Time-Consuming:** Customers must call multiple workers to find availability
4. **No Payment Security:** Workers often get cheated (promise to pay later)
5. **Search is Difficult:** Facebook search is poor, hard to find specific services

**DumuWaks Advantage:** Can offer verification, reviews, secure payments, and instant booking that Facebook groups can't match.

---

### **B. WhatsApp Groups & Status Updates**

#### **Scale**

- **WhatsApp:** 90%+ of internet users in Kenya use WhatsApp
- **Service Groups:** Thousands of neighborhood WhatsApp groups
- **Example:** "Kasarani Estate Services WhatsApp Group" (500 members)

#### **How It Works**

1. **Worker posts status:** "Available for home cleaning in Kasarari today, KES 800. Call 07XX XXX XXX"
2. **Customer sees status:** Replies or calls directly
3. **Service & Payment:** In-person service, cash/M-Pesa payment

#### **Strengths**

1. **Free:** No fees
2. **Immediate:** Workers post "available now" status
3. **Trusted Networks:** Neighborhood groups have some trust
4. **Multimedia:** Workers can post photos/videos of their work

#### **Weaknesses**

1. **Limited Reach:** Only group members see posts (100-500 people max)
2. **No Discovery:** Customers can't search for workers outside their groups
3. **No Reviews:** No way to verify quality before booking
4. **No Guarantees:** If worker doesn't show up, no recourse

**DumuWaks Advantage:** Can reach millions of customers (not just 500), provide search/discovery, reviews, and booking guarantees.

---

### **C. Classifieds (Jiji, Cheki, PigiaMe)**

#### **Jiji.co.ke**

- **Model:** Classified ads (like Craigslist)
- **Services Section:** Has "Services" category but poorly used
- **Volume:** 5,000-10,000 service ads at any time
- **Pricing:** Free to post, paid to feature ad

#### **How It Works**

1. **Worker posts ad:** "Experienced barber, Kasarani, KES 300, call 07XX"
2. **Customer searches:** "Barber Kasarani" on Jiji
3. **Contact:** Customer calls worker directly
4. **Transaction:** Cash/M-Pesa directly (no platform fees)

#### **Strengths**

1. **Free to Post:** No commission
2. **Searchable:** Can find workers by location and category
3. **Large Traffic:** Jiji has 5+ million monthly visitors in Kenya
4. **Photos:** Workers can post photos

#### **Weaknesses**

1. **Static Listings:** Ads become outdated (worker might be fully booked)
2. **No Real-Time Availability:** Can't see who's available today
3. **No Verification:** Anyone can post
4. **No Reviews:** No quality signals
5. **No Booking:** Must call worker (can't book directly)

**DumuWaks Advantage:** Real-time availability, instant booking, verified workers, reviews, secure payments.

|----------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Lynk** | 20-25% | KES 50-100 | Worker: KES 1,125-1,200 <br> Customer: KES 1,550-1,600 |

## 5. Competitive Gaps & Opportunities

### **Gap 1: No Platform Focuses on Barbers/Hairdressers**

**Current Situation:**
- Lynk: No barbers/hairdressers
- Jumia Services: No barbers/hairdressers
- Tujenge: No barbers/hairdressers
- Facebook groups: Fragmented, no booking system

**DumuWaks Opportunity:**
- **First-mover advantage** in the KES 1.8-2.2 trillion ($14-17B) personal care market
- Barbers/hairdressers are **highly active on social media** (easy to onboard)
- **High frequency** demand (customers need haircuts every 2-4 weeks)

**Strategy:**
- Launch with barbers/hairdressers as **primary category**
- Emphasize mobile barbers (home/office service) for premium segment
- Build specialized features (photo galleries of hairstyles, appointment scheduling)

---

### **Gap 2: Weak Verification Across All Platforms**

**Current Situation:**
- Lynk: ID upload only (anyone can fake this)
- Tujenge: ID upload only
- Jumia Services: ID + selfie (better, but still weak)
- FixKE: ID + skill testing (good for niche)

**Customer Fear:** "Will this person steal from me?" "Are they actually skilled?"

**DumuWaks Opportunity:**
- **Comprehensive background checks** (criminal records, references)
- **In-person vetting** for high-risk categories (cleaners, nannies, massage)
- **Skill verification** (portfolio review, practical tests for mechanics)
- **Video profiles** (customers can see and hear workers before booking)

**Strategy:**
- Position DumuWaks as the **"Safe & Secure"** platform
- Emphasize verification in marketing ("All workers background checked")
- Charge a small verification fee (KES 100-200) to cover costs

---

### **Gap 3: Poor Worker Experience & High Churn**

**Current Situation:**
- Workers complain about high commissions (20-30%)
- Workers complain about poor customer support
- Workers leave platforms after 2-3 months (not enough jobs, high commission)
- No tools for workers to manage their business (no scheduling, no client database)

**DumuWaks Opportunity:**
- **Lower commissions (12-15%)** = happier workers, higher retention
- **Worker-focused app features** (schedule management, earnings tracking, client notes)
- **Tiered commission structure** (reward high-performing workers with lower commission)
- **Subscription model** (workers pay KES 500-1,000/month for 0% commission)

**Strategy:**
- Position DumuWaks as **"Worker-Friendly"** (we take less, you keep more)
- Provide tools that help workers grow their business (not just find gigs)
- Build community (worker meetups, training programs)

---

### **Gap 4: Limited Geographic Coverage**

**Current Situation:**
- Lynk: Nairobi + parts of Mombasa only
- Jumia Services: Nairobi + Mombasa only
- Tujenge: Nairobi only
- FixKE: Nairobi only

**DumuWaks Opportunity:**
- **Secondary cities** (Nakuru, Kisumu, Eldoret) are underserved
- These cities have **500,000-800,000 residents each** with growing middle class
- Competition is **zero or minimal** in these cities

**Strategy:**
- Start in Nairobi (prove the model)
- Expand to **Nakuru** (Phase 2, Month 7-12) - 500,000+ population
- Expand to **Kisumu** (Phase 2, Month 10-15) - 400,000+ population
- Become the **first nationwide service marketplace**

---

### **Gap 5: No Subscription or Membership Models**

**Current Situation:**
- All competitors use transaction-based model (commission per booking)
- No subscription options for frequent customers
- No membership options for workers

**DumuWaks Opportunity:**
- **Customer Subscription:** KES 500-1,000/month for unlimited booking (no fees)
- **Worker Subscription:** KES 500-1,000/month for 0% commission (pay per lead instead)
- **Corporate Memberships:** Sell to companies (for employee services)

**Strategy:**
- Launch subscription model in Month 6-9 (after proving traction)
- Target frequent customers (weekly cleaning, bi-weekly barber visits)
- Create predictable revenue (subscriptions vs transactional)

---

## 6. Threat Assessment

### **High Threat Competitors**

1. **Lynk (if they expand categories):**
   - If Lynk adds barbers, cleaners, mechanics, they become a major threat
   - They have funding, brand recognition, and tech infrastructure
   - **Mitigation:** Move fast, capture barbers/cleaners first, build brand before Lynk expands

2. **New Entrants with Venture Capital:**
   - A well-funded startup could copy DumuWaks model and outspend on marketing
   - **Mitigation:** Build deep category focus (barbers/cleaners) that broad competitors can't match

### **Medium Threat Competitors**

3. **Jumia Services (if they lower commissions):**
   - Jumia has brand, funding, and customer base
   - If they drop from 30% to 15% commission, they become more competitive
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on worker experience (Jumia has poor worker reviews)

4. **Facebook/WhatsApp (if they add marketplace features):**
   - Facebook could add booking, payments, reviews to groups
   - **Mitigation:** Hard for Facebook to add verification, background checks, escrow payments

### **Low Threat Competitors**

5. **Tujenge, FixKE:**
   - Too small, underfunded, limited categories
   - Can be acquired if needed

---

## 7. Winning Strategy for DumuWaks

### **Differentiation Pillars**

1. **Category Specialization:**
   - "The Home of Kenyan Barbers" (own this niche)
   - "Kenya's Trusted Home Cleaners" (own this niche)
   - Don't try to be everything to everyone (Lynk's weakness)

2. **Trust & Safety:**
   - "Every Worker Verified" (background checks, references, skill tests)
   - "100% Money-Back Guarantee" (if service is poor)
   - "Secure Escrow Payments" (workers don't get paid until customer confirms)

3. **Worker-Friendly:**
   - "Lowest Commissions in Kenya" (12-15% vs 20-30%)
   - "Tools to Grow Your Business" (client database, scheduling, earnings analytics)

## 8. Key Takeaways

1. **No Dominant Player:** The market is fragmented. Lynk leads but has only 15,000-25,000 workers (tiny fraction of 8-10 million informal workers).

2. **Major Gaps Exist:** Barbers, cleaners, mechanics are underserved or completely missing from platforms.

3. **Competitors Have Weaknesses:** High commissions (20-30%), poor verification, weak worker retention, limited geography.

4. **DumuWaks Can Win By:**
   - Focusing on underserved categories (barbers, cleaners, mechanics)
   - Lower commissions (12-15% vs 20-30%)
   - Better verification (background checks, skill tests)
   - Superior worker experience (tools, support, fair treatment)
   - Expanding to secondary cities (Nakuru, Kisumu) that competitors ignore

5. **Big Risk:** Lynk or Jumia could add barbers/cleaners and outspend DumuWaks on marketing. **Speed is critical.**
